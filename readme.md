# [Parental Disrection](https://genius.com/Big-pun-parental-discretion-lyrics)
start of verse

```
One look, you shook — you know I'm stickin' you
Liftin' you off the ground, look down — that's where I'm puttin' you
Look in my eyes and remember me, how does it feel mentally
Havin' the enemy be the last thing you ever see?
```

his whole part

```
My crew puff lye, anyone testin' Pun must die
Just give me one try, now you know you done fucked up, right?
Ha, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
¿Qué te pasa? You ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa, everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial, college material, insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddy do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered, I would still sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter, your shit'll shatter
I'm the kid out of the Bronx that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun 'cause one verse dead 'em all
```

# [You came up](https://genius.com/Big-pun-you-came-up-lyrics)

basiccly the whole track is a lyrical masterpiece

Part 1

```
Ay-yo, my word is bond
Long as I'm alive, I'mma put it on
Coulda gone to jake, shit, thug nigga 'til I'm gone
Weight of the Bronx, I'm flippin
Five boroughs thoroughly reppin'
Let's unite the city and step to the world as a weapon
'Cause everybody's checkin' for Pun, second to none
'Cause Latins goin' platinum was destined to come
The inevitable, heavenly, better than whatever you do
We eligible, TS is incredibly credible
For the revenue, we gettin' you open with lyrical dope
And these breaths that are potent is like an injectional dose
And it never quits
Take it from TS's top terrorist
Rapper slash hijacker, bombin' tracks ever since
I was young, I wasn't always Big Pun
It wasn't always this fun, ay-yo, I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due, lay a few
But I ain't sayin' who, stayin' true to the game
No names, playin' it cool, just me and the crew
Holdin' it down long as we round
We gonna keep sockin' it to you, like Homey D. Clown
Goin' down like 'Pac, ready to ride or die, nigga
La-da-le-la-la-la-la-la
```

Part 2

```
Ay-yo, ain't nothin' changed, I'm still the same
The way you remembered me, since the centipede
Harder, big blacker, back in the 70's
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on the block with Cuban and Seis
I still do, but now it's in the blue convertible eight-- fifty
My true niggas'll always be wit' me
The shifty kiss me, tell me they miss me, then try to diss me
'Cause I'm a rispy, crispy for life, sixtie's the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggas is sheist, but I psych 'em out
Though they like to doubt
I make 'em all believers, once I let the Tyson out
'Cause I can vouch for only a few, only the crew
From the old school, I consider loyally true
I morally grew from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotter
That's cool for a dollar
I wanna holla at my peeps that's reppin' the streets
Wrestlin' the beast of chest, restin' in peace
Blessin' my seeds and watchin' over us
'Til I die, I'll align the souls with mine and shine for all of us
```

# [Fantastic Four](https://genius.com/Dj-clue-fantastic-four-lyrics)

- ```
  And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
  Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the Devil
  I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
  I used to clap shit, now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
  I used to have to pack a mack in back of the Ac
  Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
  It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
  My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
  I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
  With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose
  ```
